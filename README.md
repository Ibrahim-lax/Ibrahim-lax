## About me

My background is built on the rigorous 42 common core curriculum, which is centered around C and C++. Through this, I developed a strong understanding of low-level memory management, data structures, and fundamental algorithms.


Additionally I've been previously in an electronic/electric engineering school where I studied theoritical concepts about robotic/automation systems, this provided me with a unique perspective on the bridge between hardware and software.


Currently, I am in the final phase of the 42 Common Core, focusing on my final project ft_transcendence that relies on the recent modern web developement stacks.


Moving forward, Im continuing expanding my theoretical and practical knowledge by learning new stacks, including Web Development, AI, Devops as I continue my journey at 42.
